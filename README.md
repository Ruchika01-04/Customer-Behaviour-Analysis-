# 📊 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using transactional retail data. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights related to customer demographics, purchasing patterns, discounts, subscriptions, and product performance. The analysis helps businesses make data-driven decisions to improve sales, customer engagement, and retention strategies.


## 📂 Dataset

* **Source:** Kaggle
* **Type:** Transactional, demographic, and behavioral data
* **Size:** 3,900 rows × 18 columns

### Key Features:

* Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location)
* Purchase details (Item, Category, Amount, Season)
* Customer behavior (Discounts, Reviews, Purchase Frequency)
* Subscription status and shipping type

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA
 **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy
* **SQL** – Business analysis using PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
* **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation
* **Gamma** – Report and PPT generation
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis environment

 🔍 EDA & Data Cleaning

* Loaded dataset using Python (pandas)
* Checked data structure and summary statistics
* Identified missing values in review ratings
* Handled missing values using category-wise median
* Standardized column names for consistency
* Removed redundant and unnecessary columns
* Created new features such as age groups and purchase frequency

 # 🧮 **SQL Analysis**

Business-focused SQL queries were used to analyze:

* Revenue by gender
* High-spending discount users
* Top-rated and most-purchased products
* Subscription vs non-subscription spending
* Shipping type impact on purchase amount
* Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)
* Revenue contribution by age group

# 📊 ** Dashboard**

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** was built to visualize:

* Total customers and average purchase value
* Revenue by category and age group
* Subscription status distribution
* Sales and spending trends
* Customer segmentation insights

The dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly understand key business metrics and trends.

# 📈 **Results & Insights**

* Loyal customers contribute the majority of purchases
* Express shipping users spend more on average
* Discounts increase sales but require margin control
* Certain age groups and categories generate higher revenue
* Subscription users show strong retention potential
